# Terminal Access for NVDA

An NVDA add-on that makes Windows terminal applications more accessible. It adds keyboard-driven review navigation, search, bookmarks, and audio cues to 30 supported terminals, including Windows Terminal, PowerShell, Command Prompt, WSL, and popular third-party emulators.

## Key Features

- Command layer (NVDA+apostrophe) that turns every command into a single key press
- Line, word, and character navigation through terminal output
- Search with a results dialog, plus next and previous match keys
- Up to 10 bookmarks per tab with a bookmark list dialog
- Section, error, and prompt navigation for jumping through long output
- Error and warning audio cues with structured pattern detection
- Quiet mode for fast-scrolling output, with optional error tones
- Application profiles that auto-adjust settings for vim, tmux, git, less, WSL, and AI CLI tools
- AI CLI support: turn navigation, code block navigation, streaming delta announcements
- Offline summarization of command output
- URL extraction, tab management, color and formatting reports, selection and copy
- Fully offline. No terminal content ever leaves your machine.
