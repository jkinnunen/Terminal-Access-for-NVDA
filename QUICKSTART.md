# Terminal Access for NVDA - Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Terminal Access for NVDA! This quick start guide will help you get up and running in minutes.

## What is Terminal Access for NVDA?

Terminal Access for NVDA is an add-on that enhances terminal accessibility on Windows. It provides navigation, reading, and interaction features specifically designed for command-line interfaces. Inspired by [TDSR](https://github.com/tspivey/tdsr) and [Speakup](https://github.com/linux-speakup/speakup).

## Installation (1 minute)

1. Download the latest `.nvda-addon` file from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/PratikP1/Terminal-Access-for-NVDA/releases/latest)
2. Press Enter on the downloaded file
3. Confirm installation
4. Restart NVDA

That's it! The add-on is now installed.

## First Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open a Terminal
Open any supported terminal: Windows Terminal, PowerShell, Command Prompt, WSL, or any of the 30 supported terminal emulators (including Alacritty, WezTerm, Ghostty, MobaXterm, and more).

You'll hear: *"Terminal Access support active. Press NVDA+shift+f1 for help."*

### Step 2: Enter the Command Layer (Recommended)
Press **NVDA+'** (apostrophe) to enter the **command layer**. You'll hear "Terminal commands" and a high-pitched tone. Now every command is a single key press — no modifier combos needed!

Try navigating:
- **I** - Read current line
- **O** - Read next line
- **U** - Read previous line
- **K** - Read current word
- **L** - Read next word
- **J** - Read previous word
- **Escape** or **NVDA+'** - Exit the command layer

### Step 3: Try More Commands in the Layer
While in the command layer:

- **A** - Continuous reading (say all)
- **;** - Announce position (row, column)
- **F** - Search terminal output
- **Q** - Toggle quiet mode
- **F1** - Open user guide

Press **Escape** when done.

### Step 4: Character Reading
Enter the command layer (**NVDA+'**) and try:

- **M** - Read previous character
- **,** (comma) - Read current character (twice for phonetic, three times for code)
- **.** (period) - Read next character

### Step 5: Try Advanced Features
Still in the command layer:

- **Home/End** - Jump to start/end of line
- **PageUp/PageDown** - Jump to top/bottom of buffer
- **Shift+Arrows** - Read to edge (left/right/up/down)
- **[/]** - Decrease/increase punctuation level
- **D** - Toggle indentation announcement

### Step 6: Direct Gestures (Alternative)
All commands also work with traditional NVDA modifier combos for power users:

- **NVDA+I** - Read current line
- **NVDA+O** - Read next line
- **NVDA+U** - Read previous line
- **NVDA+K** - Read current word
- **NVDA+A** - Continuous reading (say all)

These direct gestures can be remapped in NVDA's Input Gestures dialog under "Terminal Access".

2. Use **NVDA+A** for continuous reading (say all)
3. Or use **NVDA+U/I/O** to read line by line
4. Use **NVDA+Shift+Q** to enable quiet mode if output is verbose

### Using Punctuation Levels
1. Press **NVDA+]** to increase level
2. Type commands with symbols (@, #, $, etc.)
3. Hear more or fewer symbols based on level
4. Level 2 (Most) is ideal for code and scripts
5. Level 0 (None) is good for prose

## Tips for Efficiency

1. **Use the Command Layer**: Press NVDA+' to enter single-key mode — much faster than modifier combos
2. **Use Continuous Reading**: Press A (in layer) to read long output instead of navigating line by line
3. **Master Punctuation Levels**: Press [/] (in layer) to match your current task (code vs. prose)
4. **Use Directional Reading**: Shift+Arrow combos quickly scan portions without moving cursor
5. **Learn Screen Edge Navigation**: Jump to line/buffer boundaries with Home/End/PageUp/PageDown
6. **Use Mark-Based Selection**: For precise text extraction from tables or structured output
7. **Check Indentation**: Press I twice (in layer) or NVDA+I twice for Python/YAML code
8. **Use Quiet Mode**: Press Q (in layer) when commands produce lots of output
9. **Remap Gestures**: All commands appear in NVDA's Input Gestures under "Terminal Access"
10. **Practice Commands**: Muscle memory makes navigation much faster

## Troubleshooting
