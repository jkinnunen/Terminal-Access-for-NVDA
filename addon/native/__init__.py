"""
Native (Rust) acceleration layer for Terminal Access.

Phase 1 — DLL-based drop-in replacements for CPU-bound algorithms::

    from native.termaccess_bridge import (
        native_available,
        NativeTextDiffer,
        NativePositionCache,
    )

Phase 2 — Helper process for off-main-thread UIA reads::

    from native.termaccess_bridge import (
        helper_available,
        get_helper,
        stop_helper,
    )

    helper = get_helper()
    if helper:
        text = helper.read_text(hwnd)

If the DLL or helper cannot be loaded, callers should fall back to
the pure-Python implementations.
