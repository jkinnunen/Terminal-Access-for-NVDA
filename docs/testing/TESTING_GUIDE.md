# Testing Guide for Terminal Access for NVDA

This guide covers automated and manual testing procedures for the Terminal Access add-on.

---

## Part 1: Automated Testing

### Python Version Requirements

**Terminal Access requires NVDA 2025.1 or later**, which uses Python 3.11.

The test suite runs on Python 3.11 via CI/CD.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Or use pytest directly
pytest tests/
```

### Test Suite Overview

The test suite has **40 test files** with **778 passing tests** (67 skipped for native bridge).

Tests cover:
- Input validation and security hardening
- Position caching and thread safety
- Configuration management
- Selection operations and terminal detection
- Application profiles and profile management
- Bookmarks, search, URL extraction
- Error line detection
- Gesture conflict detection
- Settings panel
- Native bridge (skipped when Rust DLL unavailable)
- Performance benchmarks and regression tests
- Integration workflows

#### Coverage

- **Total coverage**: ~54% (measures both `terminalAccess.py` and `addon/lib/`)
- **CI threshold**: 70% on covered modules
- **lib/ modules**: Higher coverage since they were extracted for testability

### Running Tests

#### Run All Tests
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

This runs all tests with verbose output and generates a coverage report.

#### Run Specific Test Files
```bash
pytest tests/test_validation.py -v
pytest tests/test_gesture_conflicts.py -v
```

#### Run Specific Test Methods
```bash
pytest tests/test_validation.py::TestValidation::test_integer_range -v
```

#### Run with Coverage Report
```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=addon --cov-report=html tests/

# Open coverage report
# Windows: start htmlcov/index.html
```

### CI/CD Testing

Tests run automatically on:
- Every push to `main`, `develop`, and feature branches
- Every pull request

#### GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Test Matrix**: Python 3.11 on Windows
- **Linting**: flake8 on Ubuntu
- **Coverage**: 70%+ required (enforced)
- **Build**: scons build verification

View test results in the Actions tab on GitHub.

### Writing Tests

#### Test Structure
```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

class TestFeature(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        pass

    def test_feature_behavior(self):
        """Test specific behavior."""
        # Arrange
        expected = "value"

        # Act
        result = some_function()

        # Assert
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)
```

#### Mocking NVDA Modules
Use fixtures from `tests/conftest.py`:
```python
def test_with_terminal(mock_terminal):
    """Test with mocked terminal."""
    result = mock_terminal.makeTextInfo()
    assert result is not None
```
