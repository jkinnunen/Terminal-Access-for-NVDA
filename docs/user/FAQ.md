## Features and Usage

### What keyboard shortcuts does Terminal Access provide?

Key navigation commands (customize in NVDA Input Gestures):
- **Line Navigation**: NVDA+U/I/O (previous/current/next)
- **Word Navigation**: NVDA+J/K/L (previous/current/next)
- **Help**: NVDA+Shift+F1
- **Cursor Tracking**: NVDA+Alt+Y (cycle modes)
- **Search**: NVDA+F

Refer to the main README for the complete gesture list.

### What are application profiles?

Application profiles allow Terminal Access to automatically adjust settings when you switch between applications. For example:
- **vim**: Higher punctuation level (for code), silent status line
- **tmux**: Silent status bar
- **git**: Optimized for diffs and logs
- **htop**: Optimized for process viewer layout

You can create custom profiles for any application.

### How do I navigate between AI responses?

Terminal Access detects AI CLI tools (Claude, Aider, ChatGPT CLI, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, Ollama) and tokenizes the conversation buffer into turns. Press Ctrl+T in the command layer (or NVDA+Alt+T) to jump to the next turn. Press Shift+T in the command layer (or NVDA+Alt+Shift+T) to jump to the previous turn. When you land on a turn, you hear the role (user or assistant) and the first line.

### What are the code block commands?

When an AI assistant includes code in its response, Terminal Access detects fenced code blocks. Use these commands to work with them:

| Command Layer Key | Direct Gesture         | Action                               |
|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Ctrl+B**        | **NVDA+Alt+B**         | Next code block                      |
| **Shift+B**       | **NVDA+Alt+Shift+B**   | Previous code block                  |
| **Ctrl+L**        | **NVDA+Alt+L**         | Announce language                    |
| **Ctrl+C**        | **NVDA+Alt+C**         | Copy code block to clipboard         |
| **Ctrl+E**        | **NVDA+Alt+E**         | Explain code block (privacy gated)   |

### How does privacy mode work?

AI CLI features that send terminal content to an external AI service are gated by privacy settings. Both "Allow Code Explain" and "Allow Summarization" are off by default. When you try to use a privacy-gated feature while it is disabled, you hear a spoken message explaining how to enable it. Open Terminal Access settings and look for the Privacy section to enable these features.

### Why did I hear a different error tone?

Terminal Access plays distinct tones for AI-specific errors. A pulsing low tone (two quick 220 Hz beeps) indicates a rate limit or token limit. A single low tone indicates an API error such as authentication failure or server error. These are separate from the standard build error and warning tones. You can disable all error tones by unchecking "Error and Warning Audio Cues" in Terminal Access settings.

### Can I export and share profiles?

Yes! (v1.0.24+)
1. Open NVDA Settings → Terminal Access → Application Profiles
2. Select a profile
3. Click "Export..."
4. Save the JSON file
5. Share the file with others

To import:
1. Click "Import..."
2. Select a profile JSON file
3. The profile will be added to your list

### What is cursor tracking?

Cursor tracking automatically announces the cursor's position as you navigate. Terminal Access offers three modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Off (0)** | No automatic announcements |
| **Standard (1)** | Announces character at cursor |
| **Window (2)** | Announces cursor within defined window regions |

Cycle modes with NVDA+Alt+Y.

### What are window definitions?

Window definitions let you define specific screen regions with different behaviors. For example, in vim:
- **Editor region**: Lines 1-N (normal speech)
- **Status line**: Last line (silent)

This prevents repetitive announcements of status bars and other UI elements.

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal Access gestures don't work in my terminal

**Check**:
1. Is the terminal supported? (See compatibility list)
2. Is focus in the terminal window?
3. Are Terminal Access gestures conflicting with terminal shortcuts?
   - Try remapping conflicting gestures in NVDA Input Gestures

**If the terminal isn't supported**:
- Open a Terminal Support Request on GitHub

### Cursor tracking announces too much/too little

**Adjust cursor tracking mode**:
- Press NVDA+Alt+Y to cycle through modes (Off, Standard, Window)
- Try different modes for different workflows:
  - **Standard**: For general use
  - **Window**: For applications with defined regions
  - **Off**: When you prefer manual navigation

### Profile doesn't apply automatically

**Troubleshooting steps**:
1. Check NVDA log (NVDA+F1) for profile detection messages
2. Verify the profile exists in Terminal Access Settings → Application Profiles
3. Check the application module name matches the profile:
   - Open NVDA Python Console (NVDA+Control+Z)
   - Run: `api.getForegroundObject().appModule.appName`
   - Compare with profile name
4. Manual profile application:
   - Try exporting and re-importing the profile
   - Check JSON for correct `appName` field

### Third-party terminal not detected

**Symptoms**: Terminal Access doesn't activate in a third-party terminal

**Solutions**:
1. Verify terminal is supported (see compatibility list in the README)
2. Check application name:
   - Open NVDA Python console (NVDA+Control+Z)
   - Run: `api.getForegroundObject().appModule.appName`
   - Compare with supported terminal names
3. Create a GitHub issue:
   - Include terminal name and version
   - Include appModule name from step 2
   - We can add support in a future release

### RTL text (Arabic/Hebrew) displays incorrectly

**Required dependencies**:
```bash
pip install python-bidi arabic-reshaper
```

**After installation**:
1. Restart NVDA
2. Verify dependencies loaded successfully in NVDA log

Without these libraries, Terminal Access provides basic Unicode support but not full RTL handling.

### Performance is slow in large buffers

**Optimizations** (automatic in v1.0.21+):
- Position caching reduces repeat calculations
- Incremental tracking optimizes small movements
- Background processing for large selections

**If still slow**:
- Use search/jump commands instead of line-by-line navigation
- Consider reducing buffer size in terminal settings
- Report performance issues on GitHub with buffer size details

### Emoji displaying as single characters

**Symptoms**: Complex emoji (family, flags) show as multiple characters

**Solutions**:
1. Install emoji library:
   ```bash
   pip install emoji
   ```
2. Restart NVDA after installing
3. If still not working:
   - Check terminal's emoji support
   - Some terminals may not render complex emoji sequences

### No speech when moving cursor

**Problem**: Nothing is announced when using arrow keys.

**Solutions**:
1. **Enable Cursor Tracking**: NVDA menu > Preferences > Settings > Terminal Settings > Enable "Cursor Tracking"
2. **Check Quiet Mode**: Press NVDA+Shift+Q to toggle quiet mode off
3. **Verify tracking mode**: Press NVDA+Alt+Y (or layer: Y) to cycle through tracking modes (check it is not "Off")
4. **Adjust Cursor Delay**: Try setting delay to 0ms if responses are too slow

### Punctuation not announced

**Problem**: Symbols and punctuation aren't being read.

**Solutions**:
1. **Increase punctuation level**: Press NVDA+equals to increase level
2. **Check current level**: Open Terminal Settings to see punctuation level (0-3)
3. **Try level 3**: Set to "All" (level 3) to hear everything
4. **Note**: Level 0 (None) doesn't announce any punctuation

### Colors/formatting not announced

**Problem**: NVDA+Shift+A doesn't announce colors.

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify color codes exist**: Colors may not be present in current terminal content
2. **Check terminal support**: Verify your terminal supports ANSI color codes
3. **Try test**: Run `echo -e "\x1b[31mRed text\x1b[0m"` to test with known colored text
4. **Update**: You need v1.0.18 or later for full ANSI support

### Selection marks not working

**Problem**: Can't set or clear selection marks.

**Solutions**:
1. **Correct sequence**: Press NVDA+R to toggle marks. First press sets start, second sets end, third clears.
2. **Check messages**: Listen for "Mark start set", "Mark end set", or "Marks cleared"
3. **Copy after marks**: Press NVDA+C after both marks are set
4. **Clear and retry**: Press NVDA+X to clear marks if confused

### Window tracking silent

**Problem**: Cursor announcements stop in certain screen areas.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check window mode**: You may be in Window tracking mode with defined boundaries
2. **Verify window bounds**: Check Terminal Settings for window coordinates
3. **Clear window**: Press NVDA+Alt+F3 to clear window definition
4. **Switch mode**: Press NVDA+Alt+Y (or layer: Y) to use Standard tracking instead

### Settings not saving

**Problem**: Configuration changes don't persist after restart.

**Solutions**:
1. **Save properly**: Click "OK" or "Apply" in settings dialog
2. **Check permissions**: Verify NVDA can write to the configuration directory
3. **NVDA profile**: If using NVDA profiles, settings are profile-specific
4. **Reset config**: Try deleting NVDA configuration and reconfiguring

### Build/Installation issues

**Problem**: Can't build or install the add-on.

**Solutions**:
1. **Python version**: You need Python 3.11 or later
2. **Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` for development
3. **Build command**: Use `scons` from the project root (needs the markdown package and msgfmt from gettext)
4. **NVDA restart**: Always restart NVDA after installing/updating add-on
5. **Check logs**: View NVDA log (NVDA+F1) for detailed error messages

### How to report issues

If problems persist:

1. **Check NVDA log**: NVDA menu > Tools > View log for error details
2. **Enable debug logging**: NVDA menu > Preferences > Settings > General > Log level: Debug

## Advanced Topics

### How do I create a custom profile?

**Current method** (profile editor coming in future release):
1. Export an existing similar profile as a template
2. Edit the JSON file:
   - Change `appName` to match your application
   - Adjust `punctuationLevel`, `cursorTrackingMode`, etc.
   - Add window definitions if needed
3. Import the modified profile

**Example profile**:
```json
{
  "appName": "myapp",
  "displayName": "My Custom App",
  "punctuationLevel": 2,
  "cursorTrackingMode": 1,
  "quietMode": false,
  "keyEcho": true,
  "windows": []
}
```

### How do I add window definitions to a profile?

Window definitions are specified in the profile JSON:

```json
{
  "windows": [
    {
      "name": "status",
      "top": 9999,
      "bottom": 9999,
      "left": 1,
      "right": 9999,
      "mode": "silent",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Coordinates are 1-based. Use 9999 for "last row/column".

**Modes**:
- `announce`: Normal speech
- `silent`: No speech
- `monitor`: Track changes (future feature)

### Can I use Terminal Access with screen or tmux?

Yes! Terminal Access has a built-in profile for tmux:
- Silent status bar (bottom line)
- Standard cursor tracking
- Optimized for multiplexed workflows

For screen, you can:
1. Export the tmux profile
2. Rename it to "screen"
3. Import it back

### Does Terminal Access support emoji?

Yes! (v1.0.25+) Terminal Access handles:
- Basic emoji
- Emoji with skin tone modifiers
- Zero-width joiner sequences (family, flags, professions)
- Accurate width calculation

**For full support, install**:
```bash
pip install emoji
```

### What Unicode features does Terminal Access support?

**v1.0.25 Unicode features**:
- **CJK characters**: Double-width calculation and column extraction
- **RTL text**: Arabic and Hebrew with bidirectional algorithm
- **Emoji sequences**: Complex multi-codepoint emoji
- **Combining characters**: Zero-width marks

**Optional dependencies**:
```bash
pip install python-bidi arabic-reshaper emoji
```

Terminal Access gracefully degrades without these libraries.

### How do I check for gesture conflicts?

Terminal Access detects when its keyboard shortcuts conflict with other NVDA add-ons. Open NVDA menu > Preferences > Settings > Terminal Settings. The "NVDA Gesture Conflicts" section lists all direct gestures. Uncheck any gesture to disable it and avoid the conflict. Disabled gestures remain accessible through the command layer (NVDA+apostrophe).

### What are the audio tones during line navigation?

Terminal Access plays distinct tones when you navigate to a line containing an error or a warning. Error lines produce a low tone; warning lines produce a higher tone. These cues help you spot problems in build output or log files without reading every line. The feature is controlled by the **Error Audio Cues** setting (on by default). A separate setting, **Error Audio Cues in Quiet Mode**, enables these tones on caret events while quiet mode is active (off by default).

### What are output activity tones?

When **Output Activity Tones** is enabled (off by default), Terminal Access plays two ascending tones (600 Hz then 800 Hz) whenever new program output appears. The **Output Activity Debounce** setting controls the minimum interval between tones (default 1000 ms, range 100 to 10000 ms). This is useful when you want an audible signal that a command has produced output without reading every line.

### Do Terminal Access gestures work outside terminals?

No. Terminal Access gestures only activate inside supported terminals. Outside a terminal window, the gestures pass through to NVDA or other add-ons. Terminal detection uses exact match on the process name, so only recognized terminal applications trigger the add-on.

### Can I contribute to Terminal Access development?

Yes! Contributions are welcome:
- **Code**: Submit pull requests on GitHub
- **Documentation**: Improve guides and translations
- **Testing**: Test with different terminals and workflows
- **Bug Reports**: Report issues with detailed information
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest improvements

See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.
