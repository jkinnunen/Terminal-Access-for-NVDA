## Documentation Organization Principles

1. **User-First**: User documentation is separate from developer documentation
2. **Current vs. Historical**: Active documentation is at the top level; historical artifacts are archived
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Avoid duplication; link to canonical sources
4. **Clear Navigation**: Each document links to related documents
5. **Preservation**: Historical documents are archived, not deleted, for future reference

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing documentation:
- User-facing docs go in `user/`
- Developer/technical docs go in `developer/`
- Testing-related docs go in `testing/`
- Historical/superseded docs go in `archive/` with version/date notation
- Update README.md in the repository root when adding new documentation
- Keep the CHANGELOG.md updated with documentation changes

## Version History

This documentation structure was established in **v1.0.32** to:
- Reduce root-level clutter (from 23 to 6 markdown files)
- Organize documentation by audience
- Archive historical development artifacts

For the complete version history, see [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).
