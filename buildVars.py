	addon_changelog=_("""v2.2.0 acts on user reports and an NVDA developer's review.

Now supported: any terminal NVDA recognizes, instead of only those on a built-in list, so terminals the add-on used to ignore work, including ones released after this version. Find also reaches the scrollback on the legacy Windows console: NVDA can only read the visible screen there, so Terminal Access reads the console's full buffer itself.

Fixed: braille follows the cursor in terminals again. Typing did not update the display until you panned away and back, and the display never jumped back to the cursor. Search-result jumps are also faster and land more reliably.

Earlier in 2.1.0: the buffer window. Press NVDA+Enter in a terminal to open the whole scrollback as a browsable snapshot: arrow through it, press H to move between the commands you ran and the errors they produced, follow the table of contents, read columnar output as real tables, and activate web links. NVDA+Shift+Enter opens a jump to line dialog that moves the review cursor to any line, found by its text. In the command layer, Shift+E opens an errors-only view and Shift+C a commands-only view.

Also: punctuation keys are now named in the guide and command finder (NVDA+semicolon rather than a symbol your punctuation level may silence), the spell-word command reads as NVDA+K twice, and a jump whose line has scrolled out of history says so instead of failing silently.

Laptop keyboard layout: NVDA+Enter is NVDA's activate-navigator-object command; Terminal Access takes it only inside terminals. Use the command layer's Enter or reassign in Input Gestures if you need NVDA's command there.

Requires NVDA 2025.1 or later. Existing settings are preserved on upgrade."""),
