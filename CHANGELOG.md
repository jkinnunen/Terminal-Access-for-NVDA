# Changelog

All notable changes to Terminal Access for NVDA will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Native Rust acceleration layer**: CPU-bound text processing (ANSI stripping, diff computation,
  regex search, unicode width calculation) is now handled by a native Rust DLL (`termaccess.dll`)
  loaded via ctypes. Falls back gracefully to pure-Python when the DLL is unavailable.
- **Helper process for off-main-thread UIA reads**: A background `termaccess-helper.exe` process
  reads terminal buffers via UIA TextPattern over a named-pipe IPC channel, keeping NVDA's main
  thread responsive. Supports UIA subscriptions with event-driven `TextDiff` notifications.
- **Console API fallback**: Terminals without UIA TextPattern (some conhost configurations, mintty,
  older PuTTY builds) can now be read via `ReadConsoleOutputCharacterW` as a fallback path.
- **Rust-accelerated search**: `OutputSearchManager.search()` now delegates pattern matching to the
  native DLL (with ANSI stripping built in). When the helper is running, search executes as a single
  IPC round-trip with no buffer transfer to Python.
- **Unicode width offloading**: `UnicodeWidthHelper` methods (`getCharWidth`, `getTextWidth`,
  `extractColumnRange`, `findColumnPosition`) now use the Rust `unicode-width` crate via FFI,
  falling back to Python `wcwidth` and then ASCII width assumptions.
- **Helper auto-restart**: Exponential backoff with crash recovery — the helper process restarts
  automatically on unexpected termination, with configurable max retries and backoff intervals.
- **Local release workflow**: `release.py` provides a gated 6-step local release workflow that
  validates version, changelog, tests, build, and manifest before pushing to main.

### Fixed

- **Settings panel not loading**: The settings panel failed to launch from NVDA preferences
  because a throwaway loop variable `_` in the gesture bindings section shadowed the `_()`
  translation function, causing `UnboundLocalError` on every translatable string in the panel.
- **Intermittent "unknown" announcements**: NVDA's "Report dynamic content changes" is now
  automatically suppressed while a terminal is focused, preventing spurious "unknown" speech
  caused by transient UIA elements during rapid terminal updates. The user's original setting
  is restored when focus leaves the terminal.
- **CI release missing changelog**: The release workflow's changelog extraction skipped the
  versioned section and fell back to a generic message. Fixed to properly extract the release
  notes for the version being published.
- **CI release missing build dependency**: Added `markdown` to the release workflow's
  `pip install` to match the build chain's import requirements.

### Changed

- **Architecture documentation**: Major update to `docs/developer/ARCHITECTURE.md` documenting the
  native acceleration layer, FFI interface, IPC protocol, fallback chains, and CI/CD pipeline.
- **Removed nightly CI workflow**: The daily nightly build pipeline has been removed.

## [1.2.7] - 2026-03-12

### Security

- **URL scheme whitelist**: `webbrowser.open()` is now restricted to `http://`, `https://`, and
  `ftp://` schemes. Malicious terminal output containing `file://` or `javascript:` URLs can no
  longer trick users into opening dangerous links from the URL list dialog.
- **Profile import validation**: All fields imported via `ApplicationProfile.fromDict()` and
  `WindowDefinition.fromDict()` are now validated — integers are clamped to safe ranges, strings
  are sanitized, window modes are checked against a whitelist, and custom gesture keys must start
  with `kb:` with values that are valid Python identifiers. Prevents arbitrary code execution or
  crashes from maliciously crafted profile files.

### Fixed

- **URL list reliability**: Added error handling and logging around URL extraction and dialog
  creation. The close button now uses `wx.ID_CANCEL` with `SetEscapeId` so the Escape key works
  from any control. The number of found URLs is announced before the dialog opens.
- **Singleton dialogs**: Both the URL list (NVDA+Alt+U) and search (NVDA+Alt+F) dialogs now
  prevent multiple instances from spawning. If the dialog is already open, a spoken message
  informs the user. Dialogs use `gui.mainFrame.prePopup()`/`postPopup()` to appear in the
  foreground instead of behind the terminal window.
- **Position calculation algorithm**: `_calculate_full` was broken — it moved to the end of the
  buffer then iterated forward, so the loop never executed. Now starts from `POSITION_FIRST` and
  walks forward, correctly counting lines to the target position.
- **Off-by-one in position context**: `_getPositionContext` was adding +1 to row and column
  values that were already 1-based from `calculate()`, reporting positions like "Row 2, column 2"
  when the cursor was at row 1, column 1.
- **Window definition coordinates**: `script_setWindow` now uses `_positionCalculator.calculate()`
  to compute actual row/column values for both start and end positions. Previously, calculated
  positions were discarded into throwaway local variables. The confirmation message now reports the
  exact coordinate range (e.g., "Window defined: rows 1-10, columns 1-80").
- **Multi-tab search state divergence**: All search methods (`search()`, `next_match()`,
  `previous_match()`, `get_match_count()`, `get_current_match_info()`, `clear_search()`) now
  route through `_get_search_state()`/`_save_search_state()`. Previously, `search()` wrote
  directly to instance variables while the tab-aware path used a separate per-tab dictionary,
  causing all tabs to share the same search results.
- **WindowMonitor deadlock**: The monitoring loop held its lock while calling
  `_read_terminal_text_on_main()`, which blocks waiting for the main thread. If the main thread
  tried to acquire the same lock (e.g., `stop_monitoring()`), both threads would deadlock. The
  lock is now released before any blocking I/O.
- **SelectionProgressDialog race condition**: Replaced `time.sleep(0.1)` after dialog creation
  with `threading.Event.wait(2.0)`. The fixed sleep was a race — 100ms was not always enough for
  the main thread to create the dialog, causing early `update()` calls to silently skip.
- **Uninitialized attributes**: `_windowStartSet`, `_windowStartBookmark`, `_windowStartRow`, and
  `_windowStartCol` are now initialized in `__init__`, preventing `AttributeError` if window
  commands were invoked before these attributes were first set.
- **Regex validation**: `search()` now validates user-supplied regular expressions before
  performing any terminal I/O. Invalid patterns raise `ValueError` with a descriptive message
  instead of silently returning 0 matches.

### Changed

- **Deferred polling thread**: The new-output polling thread no longer starts eagerly in
  `__init__` (on plugin load). It now starts lazily when a terminal is actually focused in
  `event_gainFocus`, avoiding a background thread that does nothing until the user opens a
  terminal.
- **LRU cache eviction**: `PositionCache` now uses `OrderedDict.move_to_end()` to implement
  least-recently-used eviction. Previously it used plain dict insertion-order (FIFO), which
  evicted stable frequently-accessed positions while keeping stale one-off entries.

### Translations

- Added 9 new languages: Arabic, Czech, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Dutch, Polish, Turkish, and
  Ukrainian (17 languages total).
- All translations updated using DeepL API for improved quality.
- New translatable strings for URL security message and window coordinate feedback translated
  across all 17 languages.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **URL list (NVDA+Alt+U / command layer: E)**: Extract and list all URLs found in terminal
  output. Supports HTTP/HTTPS/FTP URLs, www-prefixed URLs, file:// protocol, and OSC 8 terminal
  hyperlinks. Interactive dialog with filter box, and actions to open in browser, copy to
  clipboard, or navigate to the line containing the URL.
- Bookmark gestures (NVDA+Alt+0-9 for set, Alt+0-9 for jump) now appear in NVDA's Input Gestures
  dialog, allowing users to discover and remap them.

### Changed

- Cursor tracking mode gesture changed from `NVDA+Alt+Asterisk` (layer: `*`) to `NVDA+Alt+Y`
  (layer: `Y`) for better keyboard accessibility.
- All keyboard command tables in the HTML user guide now include a Layer Key column showing the
  corresponding command layer shortcut alongside each direct gesture.

### Fixed

- Added per-gesture unbinding setting. Users can disable individual direct keyboard shortcuts in
  the settings panel to avoid conflicts with NVDA's built-in commands. All commands remain
  accessible through the command layer (NVDA+').
- Punctuation pronunciation now respects NVDA's configured language instead of using raw Unicode
  character names (e.g., "dot" instead of "full stop" for period). Symbol names are resolved
  through NVDA's `characterProcessing` module, matching the user's NVDA language setting.
- All application profile setting overrides now take effect at runtime. Profile-specific values
  for key echo, quiet mode, punctuation level, cursor tracking mode, repeated symbols,
  indentation, and line pause are applied when the corresponding profile is active, instead of
  always reading the global config. Toggle and cycle scripts update the active profile's
  in-memory override so changes take immediate effect.
- VanDyke SecureFX (SFTP client) is no longer detected as a terminal application. An exclusion
  list is checked before the supported-terminals list so non-terminal apps that share branding
  with a supported terminal are correctly rejected.
- Corrected ~30 wrong gesture references in QUICKSTART.md (e.g., `NVDA+Alt+I` → `NVDA+I`).
- Added missing Tab Management and Profiles keyboard command sections to HTML user guide.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **Command layer (NVDA+')**: A modal single-key command mode that avoids conflicts with other
  NVDA add-ons. Press NVDA+' (apostrophe) to enter the layer — all commands become simple
  single-key presses (e.g. `i` for current line, `f` for search, `a` for say all). Press Escape
  or NVDA+' again to exit. The layer auto-exits when focus leaves the terminal. The original
  NVDA+modifier gestures remain available as direct alternatives.
- **Input Gestures category**: All 53 Terminal Access scripts are now registered under the
  "Terminal Access" category in NVDA's Input Gestures dialog, allowing users to discover and
  remap any gesture.

### Fixed

- **Build script now generates manifest.ini from buildVars.py**: Previously `manifest.ini` was
  a static file that had to be manually kept in sync with `buildVars.py`, causing the v1.0.53
  NVDA store submission to fail (the addon package declared itself as v1.0.52 internally).
  The build script now auto-generates `manifest.ini` before packaging.
- **Spacebar announcing "space" when key echo is off**: On Windows 10, the legacy console host
  fires UIA caret events on every keystroke. The cursor tracking path announced the character
  at the new caret position independently of the key echo setting, creating a "shadow key echo".
  Typing-induced caret events are now suppressed when key echo is off.
- **Windows 10 (conhost) terminal compatibility improvements**: Six fixes for behavioral
  differences between the legacy console host (Windows 10) and Windows Terminal (Windows 11):
  - New output announcer no longer reads the entire buffer on every caret event when the feature
    is disabled or quiet mode is active (performance fix for conhost's 100-500 Hz caret events)
  - Line-level cache now works on terminals without bookmark offsets, saving one UIA call per
    cursor movement on conhost when content hasn't changed
  - TextDiffer normalizes trailing whitespace per line, preventing false change detections caused
    by conhost's fixed-width line padding
  - Highlight cursor mode skips ANSI escape detection on terminals that strip ANSI codes
    (Windows Terminal, Alacritty, WezTerm, Ghostty, etc.), falling through to standard cursor
    immediately instead of wasting a UNIT_LINE read
  - Background threads (polling, window monitoring, rectangular copy) now marshal UIA/COM calls
    to the main thread via wx.CallAfter, preventing intermittent errors from apartment-threaded
    COM objects
  - Position calculator compensates for scrollback on conhost, producing viewport-relative row
    numbers instead of buffer-absolute values inflated by thousands

### Changed

- **Removed automated NVDA store submission workflow**: The CI workflow for automated NVDA
  Add-on Store submissions has been removed in favor of manual submissions.

## [1.0.53] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Enhanced Braille display support**: Navigation scripts (read line, read to left/right/top/
  bottom, review home/end/top/bottom, window content, continuous read) now send output to
  Braille displays via `braille.handler.message()`. Previously these used `speech.speakText()`
  which produced zero Braille output. Cursor tracking also notifies the Braille display of
  caret movement so it shows the full line context instead of a brief single-character flash.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate key echo when NVDA's speak-typed-characters is enabled**: When NVDA's global
  "Speak typed characters" setting was on, every keystroke was announced twice — once by NVDA
  and once by the addon. The addon now detects NVDA's `speakTypedCharacters` setting and defers
  to NVDA when it is already echoing characters, eliminating the duplication.

### Changed

- **CI workflows preserve previous releases**: Removed the `delete-old-releases` workflow,
  the release cleanup step that deleted all prior versions on every new release, and the nightly
  cleanup step that deleted old nightly tags. All previous versions, tags, and release assets
  are now retained.

## [1.0.52] - 2026-02-26

### Reverted

- **Removed blank suppression logic**: Reverted the typing-based blank suppression introduced in
  v1.0.50 and refined in v1.0.51. The suppression caused issues with Braille displays not
  receiving "Blank" announcements and did not fully resolve the original spurious blank problem.
  "Blank" is now announced immediately when the caret lands on an empty or newline position,
  restoring reliable behavior for both speech and Braille output.

## [1.0.51] - 2026-02-26

### Performance

- **PositionCache**: Stores timestamps in native seconds (avoiding per-call millisecond
  conversions) and uses `.get()` for single-lookup cache access instead of `in` + `[]`.

- **TextDiffer**: Added length-based pre-checks to skip full O(n) string comparisons when the
  buffer is unchanged (same length → likely identical). Append detection uses length comparison
  before `startswith`. Dramatic length changes (>500 chars) skip the expensive `rpartition` path.

- **NewOutputAnnouncer**: Feed dedup guard (50ms minimum interval between feeds) prevents
  duplicate processing from the same event. Deadline-based coalesce timer reuses existing threads
  instead of cancel+recreate on every feed. Single config lookup per feed call. `.strip()` called
  once instead of four times per feed.

- **CommandHistoryManager**: Replaced per-command `POSITION_ALL` + O(line_num) walks with a
  single forward walk from `POSITION_FIRST`, reducing COM calls from O(n²) to O(n).

- **isTerminalApp() caching**: Results cached per `appName` in a dict, turning O(30) substring
  scans into O(1) lookups on repeated calls. Substring matching is preserved for TUI app
  detection within terminal host processes.

- **Punctuation set caching**: `_shouldProcessSymbol()` caches the current punctuation set and
  only refreshes when the punctuation level changes, avoiding repeated dict lookups.

- **Removed redundant `import re`**: Two dynamic `import re` statements inside
  `OutputSearchManager.search()` replaced with module-level `re` usage.

## [1.0.50] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **Typing-based blank suppression**: Replaced the deferred blank timer approach (which still
  announced "Blank" after 300ms and delayed output) with a simpler, more effective typing-based
  suppression. After any keystroke (especially Enter), "Blank" is suppressed for 150ms since the
  terminal output is the meaningful feedback, not the transient empty line. Navigation-triggered
  blanks (arrow keys, page up/down) are still announced immediately — no delay.

- **Faster output detection after Enter**: When blank is suppressed after typing, rapid re-feeds
  are scheduled at 50ms and 150ms intervals so the output announcer detects new content sooner
  than the normal 300ms polling interval. This reduces the perceived gap between pressing Enter
  and hearing the command output.

### Fixed

- **Command history navigation (`NVDA+H`/`NVDA+G`) silent failure**: Fixed incorrect
  `from . import ui` in `_jump_to_command` that caused an ImportError silently caught by
  exception handling, making the gestures appear to do nothing.

- **Search not finding visible text**: Added ANSI escape stripping to the search and command
  history detection. Terminal buffer text may contain ANSI formatting codes that break substring
  matching even though the text appears correctly on screen.

## [1.0.49] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **10 new terminal emulators supported**: Added Ghostty, Rio, Wave Terminal, Contour Terminal,
  Cool Retro Term, MobaXterm, SecureCRT, Tera Term, mRemoteNG, and Royal TS to the supported
  terminals list (total now 30). Each new terminal has a default application profile with
  sensible settings (SOME punctuation, standard cursor tracking).

- **5 TUI application profiles**: Added optimized profiles for popular TUI applications that
  are automatically detected by window title:
  - **Claude CLI**: Code-friendly punctuation, streaming output optimizations, status bar silenced
  - **lazygit**: Git diff-friendly punctuation, window-based cursor tracking, single-key shortcuts
  - **btop/btm**: Progress bar noise reduction, fast refresh support, CPU/memory header regions
  - **yazi**: Terminal file manager with single-key navigation
  - **k9s**: Kubernetes TUI with namespace-friendly punctuation and fast status updates

- **Last-line overwrite detection (TextDiffer)**: Added `KIND_LAST_LINE_UPDATED` to detect when
  only the last line of the terminal buffer changes (progress bars, spinners, carriage-return
  overwrites). The NewOutputAnnouncer now announces these updates by replacing (not accumulating)
  pending text, preventing stale progress info from being spoken.

### Changed

- **Simplified bookmark gestures**: Bookmark shortcuts rationalised to avoid conflicts with other
  add-ons. Set-bookmark changed from `NVDA+Shift+0-9` to `NVDA+Alt+0-9`. Jump-to-bookmark
  remains `Alt+0-9`. List-bookmarks remains `NVDA+Shift+B`.

### Improved

- **Comprehensive ANSI escape stripping**: The ANSI strip regex now handles OSC sequences (window
  titles, hyperlinks), DCS sequences (Sixel graphics), private mode CSI (`?25h` cursor show/hide),
  charset designation (`ESC(B`), and two-character ESC sequences (`ESC M`, `ESC 7`). Previously only
  basic CSI color codes were stripped, causing leftover escape fragments in announced text.

- **Window title detection ordering**: Fixed detection priority so `lazygit` is matched before
  `git`, and `btop`/`btm` are matched before `htop`, preventing false positive profile assignments.

## [1.0.48] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Fixed Announce New Output feature with background polling**: The NewOutputAnnouncer previously
  relied solely on `event_caret` to detect new terminal output. However, `event_caret` is primarily
  fired when the user moves the cursor, not when program output appears. This meant the feature
  didn't work for background processes (npm install, compilation, etc.). The fix adds a background
  polling thread that checks the terminal buffer every 300ms when the feature is enabled, ensuring
  reliable detection of new output even when caret events don't fire. The implementation:
  - Added background polling thread with 300ms interval
  - Polling starts when announceNewOutput feature is enabled
  - Preserves existing event-driven updates via event_caret
  - Thread-safe implementation with proper start/stop lifecycle
  - Added 6 comprehensive tests for polling behavior

### Added

- **Enforce CHANGELOG.md updates via CI** ([skip changelog] to bypass): New GitHub Actions
  workflow (`.github/workflows/changelog-check.yml`) blocks any PR or direct push to `main`
  that does not update `CHANGELOG.md`. Provides a clear error message with instructions.
  Non-user-facing changes (CI fixes, typos) can skip the check by adding `[skip changelog]`
  to the PR title or commit message.

### Changed

- **CHANGELOG.md audit**: Added PR number references (`(#nn)`) to all version headers from
  v1.0.47 down to v1.0.0 for full traceability. Added 11 previously undocumented PR entries
  covering bug fixes, new features, and code-quality improvements from PRs #22, #27, #29, #32,
  #34, #36–#40, #43, #48, #49, #51, and #52.

## [1.0.47] - 2026-02-24 (#53, #54)

### Changed

- **Simplified keyboard shortcuts** (#53): All terminal-scoped commands now use simpler 2-modifier combinations instead of 3-modifier combinations
  - **Dropped Alt modifier entirely** (key unchanged) for most commands:
    - Line navigation: `NVDA+Alt+U/I/O` → `NVDA+U/I/O`
    - Word navigation: `NVDA+Alt+J/K/L` → `NVDA+J/K/L`
    - Character navigation: `NVDA+Alt+M/,/.` → `NVDA+M/,.`
    - Copy/selection: `NVDA+Alt+R/C/X/V` → `NVDA+R/C/X/V`
    - Punctuation: `NVDA+Alt+[/]` → `NVDA+[/]`
    - Search: `NVDA+Alt+F` → `NVDA+F`
    - Say all: `NVDA+Alt+A` → `NVDA+A`
  - **Dropped Alt, key changed** (to avoid NVDA global conflicts):
    - Quiet mode: `NVDA+Alt+Q` → `NVDA+Shift+Q`
    - Announce new output: `NVDA+Alt+N` → `NVDA+Shift+N`
    - Position: `NVDA+Alt+P` → `NVDA+;`
    - List tabs: `NVDA+Alt+T` → `NVDA+W`
    - Indentation toggle: `NVDA+Alt+F5` → `NVDA+F5`
    - Profile announcement: `NVDA+Alt+F10` → `NVDA+F10`
    - Buffer navigation: `NVDA+Alt+Home/End` → `NVDA+Shift+Home/End`
    - Buffer navigation: `NVDA+Alt+PageUp/Down` → `NVDA+F4/F6`
    - Command history: `NVDA+Alt+Up/Down` → `NVDA+H/G`
  - **3-key → 2-key** (dropped Alt from Shift combinations):
    - Directional reading: `NVDA+Alt+Shift+Arrow` → `NVDA+Shift+Arrow`
    - Advanced commands: `NVDA+Alt+Shift+A/C/B/H/L/T` → `NVDA+Shift+A/C/B/H/L/T`
    - Set bookmark: `NVDA+Alt+Shift+0-9` → `NVDA+Shift+0-9`
  - **Unchanged** (advanced features retain Alt modifier for safety):
    - Help: `NVDA+Shift+F1`
    - Jump to bookmark: `Alt+0-9`
    - Window management: `NVDA+Alt+F2/F3/Plus/Asterisk`
    - Find next/previous: `NVDA+F3` / `NVDA+Shift+F3`
- Updated all documentation (README.md, addon/doc/en/readme.html, terminalAccess.py) to reflect new keyboard shortcuts (#54)

### Fixed (also included in this release)

- **Suppress premature "Blank" announcements after pressing Enter** (#51): After pressing Enter,
  the caret moves to a new empty line before terminal output arrives, causing the add-on to
  prematurely announce "Blank". A 300 ms suppression window (`_ENTER_SUPPRESSION_WINDOW = 0.3`)
  after Enter key presses now prevents the false announcement while preserving correct "Blank"
  readback for genuine blank lines reached via explicit navigation scripts.

### Changed (also included in this release)

- **Python 3.11 code modernization** (#52): Modernized `terminalAccess.py` with Python 3.11
  idioms:
  - Removed deprecated `typing` imports; all annotations now use built-in generics and `X | None`
    unions
  - Hoisted per-call allocations to module-level constants (`_SUPPORTED_TERMINALS`,
    `_BUILTIN_PROFILE_NAMES`, `_ANSI_HIGHLIGHT_RE`, `_PROMPT_PATTERNS`) eliminating repeated
    object construction in hot paths
  - Added `__slots__` to `TextDiffer` and `WindowDefinition` for reduced per-instance memory
  - Replaced `CommandHistoryManager` `list` with `collections.deque(maxlen=…)` for O(1)
    auto-pruning instead of O(n) `pop(0)`
  - Optimised `event_caret` to call `isTerminalApp()` once and cache the `terminalAccess` config
    sub-dict, eliminating redundant lookups on every caret event
  - Added `@functools.cache` to Unicode symbol name lookups so `unicodedata.name()` is paid
    once per unique character, not once per keystroke
  - `super()` calls modernised from `super(ClassName, self)` to `super()`

## [1.0.46] - 2026-02-24 (#44, #48, #49, #50)

### Added

- **Announce New Output feature** (#50): New `NewOutputAnnouncer` class automatically speaks newly
  appended terminal output as it arrives, without any manual navigation required.
  - Enabled/disabled with `NVDA+Alt+N` (new toggle gesture) — announces "Announce new output on/off"
  - Coalesces rapid output within a configurable window (default 200 ms) so fast-scrolling
    commands do not overwhelm the speech synthesiser
  - When more than the configured line limit arrives at once (default 20 lines), speaks a
    concise summary: e.g. "47 new lines"
  - Strips ANSI colour/formatting escape codes before speech (configurable, on by default)
  - Automatically suppressed when quiet mode is active
  - Four new settings exposed in **NVDA Preferences → Settings → Terminal Settings**:
    - **Announce new terminal output automatically** (boolean, default off)
    - **Coalesce delay** in milliseconds (50–2000, default 200)
    - **Max lines before summarising** (1–200, default 20)
    - **Strip ANSI escape codes from output** (boolean, default on)

- **TextDiffer integration in WindowMonitor**: Each monitored region now carries its own
  `TextDiffer` instance for precise, efficient change detection.
  - First poll per region establishes a silent baseline (no false announcements on startup)
  - Subsequent polls only speak when content actually changed
  - For appended output (the common case) only the newly appended text is spoken — not the
    entire region
  - For non-trivial changes (screen clear, mid-screen edit) the full region content is spoken
  - Eliminates redundant UIA/COM reads and unnecessary speech on every poll cycle

### Changed

- **Minimum NVDA version raised to 2025.1** (Python 3.11 runtime); compatibility with earlier
  NVDA versions removed
- `WindowMonitor._announce_change` now speaks the relevant content directly instead of the
  generic "Window {name} changed" string
- `ConfigManager` validation and `reset_to_defaults` extended to cover the four new
  `announceNewOutput` settings
- Settings panel `onSave` and `onResetToDefaults` updated to persist and reset new settings
- `GlobalPlugin.event_caret` feeds the current terminal buffer to `NewOutputAnnouncer` on
  every caret event (best-effort, silently skipped on any error)
- `NVDA+Alt+N` toggle resets the announcer snapshot on enable so stale buffered content is
  never replayed when the feature is turned on mid-session

### Documentation

- Added "Announce New Output" feature description with usage example to the Features section
  of the user guide (`addon/doc/en/readme.html`)
- Added `NVDA+Alt+N` row to the Modes and Toggles keyboard commands table
- Added detailed settings reference for all four new options with examples, ranges, and
  interaction notes
- Added **Scenario 6b: Hands-Free Real-Time Output Monitoring** (pytest workflow example)
- Updated Settings Interaction Summary to document how quiet mode and the new settings interact

### Tests

- 23 new unit tests in `tests/test_new_output_announcer.py` covering:
  - Appended output detection, ANSI stripping (on and off), coalescing, max-lines summary
  - Quiet mode and feature-disabled suppression
  - `TextDiffer` state reset, unchanged-content silence, changed-content silence
  - `WindowMonitor` per-region `TextDiffer` instances, initial-poll silence, silent mode,
    appended-only speech
  - `ConfigManager` validation and `reset_to_defaults` for all four new settings
  - Confspec key presence check

### Fixed (prerequisite PRs included in this release)

- **Fix text range extraction for cursor attribute reading** (#48): Resolved a critical bug where
  `setEndPoint(reviewPos, "endToStart")` produced empty or reversed text ranges, silently
  breaking `NVDA+Alt+Shift+A` (cursor attributes), `NVDA+Alt+Shift+LeftArrow` (read to left),
  `NVDA+Alt+Shift+UpArrow` (read to top), and column position calculations. Fixed by expanding
  the cursor character with `UNIT_CHARACTER` then using `setEndPoint(cursorChar, "endToEnd")` in
  `script_readAttributes`, `script_readToLeft`, `script_readToTop`, and three
  `PositionCalculator` methods. Added `tests/test_cursor_attributes.py` with coverage for range
  construction, ANSI code detection, and error handling.

### Changed (prerequisite PRs included in this release)

- **Hot-path performance: TextDiffer, line-level cache, single-pass search** (#49): Introduced
  `TextDiffer` class for O(n) appended-output detection without UIA/COM calls. Added
  `_contentGeneration` counter and a four-field line-level TextInfo cache to `GlobalPlugin`
  reducing `_announceStandardCursor` from 2–3 UIA/COM calls per caret event to 1 on cache hit.
  Refactored `OutputSearchManager.search()` from O(n_matches × avg_line_num) repeated
  `.move()` walks to a single O(total_lines) forward pass. 25 new unit tests in
  `tests/test_hot_path_optimizations.py`.

## [1.0.45] - 2026-02-23 (#47)

### Fixed

- Fixed keyboard command binding error by stripping "script_" prefix in _collectTerminalGestures() (#47)
- Keyboard gestures now bind correctly without "Error binding script" messages
- Gestures remain properly scoped to terminal windows only (not global)

## [1.0.44] - 2026-02-23 (#46)

### Changed

- **Terminal gestures scoped to focused terminal windows only** (#46): Previously, Terminal Access
  gestures fired globally; they now activate only when a terminal window is focused using
  `_updateGestureBindingsForFocus()`. Gesture bindings and copy-mode keys are disabled when
  focus leaves a terminal and re-enabled on terminal focus.
- Version bump for release

## [1.0.43] - 2026-02-23 (#43, #45)

### Fixed

- **Output search now moves review cursor to first match** (#43): Previously the search dialog
  found matches but left the review cursor unmoved, so nothing was read aloud. Now search always
  moves to the first match and reads the line, even when bookmark-based jumps are not supported
  by the terminal's TextInfo implementation.

### Changed

- Version bump for release (#45)

## [1.0.42] - 2026-02-23 (#42)

### Fixed

- **Hardened character reading and punctuation echo** (#42): Read previous/current/next character
  commands were announcing "unable to read character", and typed punctuation raised errors instead
  of speaking symbol names. Added `_processSymbol()` with `unicodedata.name()` lookup and an
  alphanumeric guard so symbols such as `!` are spoken by name. Safely copies review position and
  falls back to speaking character text if speech APIs fail.

## [1.0.41] - 2026-02-23 (#40, #41)

### Fixed

- **Guard settings panel when profile manager is absent** (#40): Opening Terminal Access settings
  could crash because the panel assumed `_profileManager` was always available. Settings panel
  now retrieves the shared `ProfileManager` from running plugins via a helper, and skips
  default-profile wiring gracefully when none exists.

### Changed

- Version bump for release (#41)

## [1.0.40] - 2026-02-23 (#34, #36, #37, #38, #39)

### Release Notes

This is the **first public release** of Terminal Access for NVDA. The add-on is now ready for general use by the screen reader community.

### Fixed

- **Search shortcut changed from NVDA+Control+F to NVDA+Alt+F** (#34): The previous shortcut
  `NVDA+Control+F` conflicted with NVDA's native Find functionality. Changed to `NVDA+Alt+F`
  across the gesture binding, user messages, README.md, QUICKSTART.md, CHANGELOG.md, HTML docs,
  and testing guides.

### Documentation

- All documentation reviewed and updated for public release (#38)
- README.md now includes direct links to CONTRIBUTING.md and docs/README.md
- Contributing section enhanced with clear navigation to contribution guidelines
- Documentation structure verified for completeness and accessibility
- Consolidated advanced user guide content into the main HTML documentation (#36):
  added "Advanced Topics" section covering Application Profiles, Third-Party Terminal Support,
  Window Definitions, Unicode/International Text, and Performance Optimization to
  `addon/doc/en/readme.html`; README.md updated to reference the HTML guide as primary doc
- Streamlined README.md by removing redundant "Additional Documentation" section (#37)

### Maintenance

- Added automated workflow to remove old GitHub releases after new ones are created, keeping
  only the latest release at any given time (#39)

## [1.0.38] - 2026-02-23 (#29, #30, #31, #32, #33)

### Added

- **Tab management with per-tab state isolation** (#32): New `TabManager` class generates unique
  tab IDs from window properties and tracks multiple tabs. `BookmarkManager`,
  `OutputSearchManager`, and `CommandHistoryManager` now maintain isolated state per tab (bookmarks
  in Tab 1 do not leak to Tab 2). Compatible with Windows Terminal, PowerShell 7+, and other
  modern multi-tab terminals. Backward-compatible legacy mode when `TabManager` is `None`.
  - `NVDA+Alt+Shift+T` — Create new tab (sends Ctrl+Shift+T)
  - `NVDA+Alt+T` — List tabs and switch to next (sends Ctrl+Tab)
- **Default Profile Setting**: Choose a default profile to use when no application-specific profile is detected
  - New config setting: `defaultProfile` (empty string by default)
  - UI: Default profile dropdown in Application Profiles section
  - Automatically applies when no app-specific profile matches
  - Use NVDA+Alt+F10 to check active and default profiles
- **Profile Status Indicators**: Profile list now shows which profiles are active and set as default
  - Active profile marked with "(Active)" indicator
  - Default profile marked with "(Default)" indicator
  - Combined indicator when profile is both: "(Active, Default)"
  - Tooltip updated to explain indicators
- **NVDA+Alt+F10 Shortcut**: Announce which profile is currently active and which is set as default
  - New `script_announceActiveProfile` command
  - Reports active profile or "None (using global settings)" if no profile active
  - Reports default profile setting
  - Example: "Active profile: Vim/Neovim. Default profile: None"

### Changed

- **Settings Shortcut Removed**: NVDA+Alt+Shift+S no longer opens settings
  - Removed gesture binding from `script_openSettings`
  - Settings now accessible only via NVDA menu > Preferences > Settings > Terminal Settings
  - Updated all documentation to remove shortcut references
  - Updated help text in plugin to remove shortcut reference
- **Bookmark Shortcuts Restored**: Bookmarks now support full 0-9 range
  - Alt+0-9 jumps to bookmarks 0-9 (all 10 bookmarks)
  - NVDA+Shift+0-9 sets bookmarks 0-9 (all 10 bookmarks)
  - Profile announcement moved to NVDA+Alt+F10 to free up NVDA+Alt+0
  - Indentation toggle moved to NVDA+Alt+F5 to free up NVDA+Alt+5
- **Author Information**: Updated author to Pratik Patel (#31)

### Fixed

- **Profile Detection**: Profiles now apply automatically when terminal applications are detected
  - Profile detection on `event_appModule_gainFocus` verified and working
  - Default profile properly applied when no app-specific profile found
  - Log messages added for profile activation tracking
- **Character navigation no longer types comma or period** (#29): `NVDA+Alt+Comma` and
  `NVDA+Alt+Period` were typing literal characters into the terminal. Replaced
  `globalCommands` delegation with a direct `_readReviewCharacter()` helper using
  `api.getReviewPosition()` and `speech.speakTextInfo()`, bypassing the gesture handling layer
  entirely to prevent key passthrough.

### Documentation

- Removed NVDA+Alt+Shift+S references from:
  - README.md (Settings and Configuration sections)
  - QUICKSTART.md (Essential Commands and Settings sections)
  - addon/doc/en/readme.html (multiple references)
  - Help text in terminalAccess.py
- Consolidated troubleshooting documentation into FAQ.md and updated WSL support docs to reflect
  complete WSL implementation since v1.0.27 (#33)
- Updated documentation across README.md, QUICKSTART.md, and addon/doc/en/readme.html to
  reflect F-key shortcuts (NVDA+Alt+F5 / NVDA+Alt+F10) and full 0-9 bookmark range (#30)

## [1.0.37] - 2026-02-22 (#27, #28)

### Added

- **Indentation Reading Feature** (#28): Automatic announcement of indentation when reading lines
  - New setting: "Announce indentation when reading lines" (default: disabled)
  - **NVDA+Alt+5**: Quick toggle for indentation announcement (announces "Indentation announcement on/off")
  - Works with all line reading commands: NVDA+Alt+U (previous line), NVDA+Alt+I (current line), NVDA+Alt+O (next line)
  - Announces indentation after line content (e.g., "4 spaces", "2 tabs", "1 tab, 3 spaces")
  - Per-application profile support: customize indentation settings for specific apps (Python, YAML editors, etc.)
  - Helper methods: `_getIndentationInfo()`, `_formatIndentation()`, `_readLineWithIndentation()`
  - Preserves existing behavior: NVDA+Alt+I pressed twice still queries indentation of current line only
  - UI integration: new checkbox in Terminal Access Settings with descriptive tooltip
  - Essential for Python, YAML, Makefiles, and other indentation-sensitive code

### Fixed

- **Keyboard Commands**: Fixed NVDA+Alt+Comma and NVDA+Alt+Period commands typing characters (#28)
  - Commands now pass `None` to globalCommands review functions instead of gesture object
  - Prevents comma and period keys from being typed when reading current/next character
  - Affected commands: NVDA+Alt+Comma (read current character), NVDA+Alt+Period (read next character)
  - Applied pattern for all gestures containing typeable characters
- **UIATextInfo position calculation** (#27): Resolved `AttributeError: 'UIATextInfo' object has
  no attribute 'moveEndToPoint'` when calculating cursor position in Windows Terminal/PowerShell.
  Replaced the non-existent `moveEndToPoint()` call with the standard TextInfo API (`setEndPoint()`
  + `len(text)`) in three locations inside `PositionCalculator._calculate_incremental()` and
  `_calculate_full()`.

### Documentation

- Updated README.md with indentation reading feature and NVDA+Alt+5 toggle (#28)
- Updated QUICKSTART.md with indentation usage examples for Python/YAML code
- Updated addon/doc/en/readme.html with complete keyboard commands and practical scenarios
- Added indentation to Settings Interactions section
- Updated Scenario 7 (Python Code Navigation) with automatic indentation workflow
- Replaced 43 instances of "TDSR" with "Terminal Access" across user-facing documentation (#27)

## [1.0.28] - 2026-02-21

### Feature - Advanced Window Monitoring (Section 6.1)

**Feature Release**: Adds support for monitoring multiple terminal windows/regions simultaneously with change detection and automatic announcements.

#### Added

- **WindowMonitor Class**: New class for multi-window monitoring with background polling
  - Monitor multiple windows/regions simultaneously
  - Configurable polling intervals per window (default: 500ms)
  - Change detection with content comparison
  - Rate limiting to prevent announcement spam (minimum 2 seconds between announcements)
  - Thread-safe operations with locking
  - Background daemon thread for continuous monitoring
  - Location: `addon/globalPlugins/tdsr.py` lines 2402-2691

- **WindowMonitor API Methods**:
  - `add_monitor(name, bounds, interval_ms, mode)` - Add window to monitor
  - `remove_monitor(name)` - Remove monitored window
  - `enable_monitor(name)` / `disable_monitor(name)` - Toggle monitoring
  - `start_monitoring()` / `stop_monitoring()` - Control background thread
  - `is_monitoring()` - Check monitoring status
  - `get_monitor_status()` - Get all monitor configurations

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 32 test cases for WindowMonitor
  - Monitor management (add, remove, enable, disable)
  - Content extraction with bounds validation
  - Change detection and announcements
  - Thread safety testing
  - Integration tests with monitoring loop
  - Location: `tests/test_window_monitor.py` (32 tests)

#### Enhanced

- **GlobalPlugin Integration**: WindowMonitor initialized and managed by plugin
  - Automatic cleanup on plugin termination
  - Stops all monitoring when NVDA closes
  - Location: `addon/globalPlugins/tdsr.py` lines 2812-2822

- **Change Detection Strategies**:
  - Line-by-line content comparison
  - Announcement of changed windows by name
  - Configurable modes: 'changes' (announce) or 'silent' (track only)
  - Rate limiting prevents spam from rapidly changing content

#### Technical Details

**Implementation Impact**:
- Code changes: 290+ lines of new WindowMonitor class
- Test coverage: 32 test cases covering all public methods
- Thread management: Daemon thread with clean shutdown
- Memory efficient: Stores last content per window for comparison
- Performance: Configurable polling intervals (100ms to multiple seconds)

**Use Cases**:
- Monitor build output in split terminal panes
- Track log file tails in tmux/screen sessions
- Monitor system status bars (htop, top, etc.)
- Track chat messages in IRC/Discord clients
- Monitor background process output
- Watch for specific content changes in defined regions

**API Usage Example**:
```python
# Initialize monitor
monitor = WindowMonitor(terminal_obj, position_calculator)

# Add monitors for different regions
monitor.add_monitor("build_output", (1, 1, 10, 80), interval_ms=1000)
monitor.add_monitor("logs", (11, 1, 20, 80), interval_ms=500)
monitor.add_monitor("status", (21, 1, 21, 80), interval_ms=2000, mode='silent')

# Start monitoring
monitor.start_monitoring()

# ... monitoring runs in background ...

# Stop when done
monitor.stop_monitoring()
```

**Thread Safety**:
- All operations use thread locking
- Safe to call from multiple threads
- Background thread cleanly terminates on stop

**Rate Limiting**:
- Minimum 2 seconds between announcements per window
- Prevents overwhelming user with rapid changes
- Configurable per-monitor intervals

**Notes**:
- WindowMonitor is an API-based feature (no keyboard gestures)
- Designed for programmatic use by applications and profiles
- Can be used in custom application profiles for tmux, screen, etc.
- Background thread is a daemon (won't prevent NVDA exit)
- Content extraction uses TextInfo API for reliability
- Bounds are 1-based (row, column) coordinates

#### Breaking Changes

None. This is a new feature that doesn't affect existing functionality.

#### Migration Guide

No migration required. WindowMonitor is available for use in v1.0.28+.

**To use WindowMonitor programmatically**:
1. Create WindowMonitor instance with terminal and position calculator
2. Add monitors for desired regions using `add_monitor()`
3. Start monitoring with `start_monitoring()`
4. Monitors run in background and announce changes automatically
5. Stop monitoring with `stop_monitoring()` when done

**Example in application profile**:
```python
# In custom profile for tmux/screen
def activate_profile(terminal, calculator):
    monitor = WindowMonitor(terminal, calculator)
    # Monitor status bar
    monitor.add_monitor("status", (24, 1, 24, 80), interval_ms=1000)
    monitor.start_monitoring()
    return monitor
```

## [1.0.15] - 2026-02-21

### Performance Optimization - Critical O(n) Issue Resolved

**Critical Issue Addressed**: Position calculation was O(n) causing ~500ms delays at row 1000

### Added
- **Position Caching System**
  - Cache stores bookmark→(row, col) mappings with 1000ms timeout
  - Thread-safe implementation with automatic cleanup of expired entries
  - Maximum cache size of 100 entries with FIFO eviction
  - Dramatically reduces repeated position calculations

- **Incremental Position Tracking**
  - Calculates position relative to last known position for small movements
  - Bidirectional tracking (forward and backward movement)
  - Activates for movements within 10 lines of last position
  - Avoids full O(n) calculation for cursor navigation

- **Background Calculation for Large Selections**
  - Threading support for rectangular selections >100 rows
  - Non-blocking UI during large copy operations
  - Progress feedback: "Processing large selection (N rows), please wait..."
  - Automatic thread management with concurrent operation detection

### Changed
- **Cache Invalidation Triggers**
  - Cache cleared on terminal focus change (switching terminals)
  - Cache cleared on typed character events (content changes)
  - Last known position reset on content modifications

- **Rectangular Selection Architecture**
  - Refactored into three methods for clarity:
    - `script_copyRectangularSelection`: Entry point with size detection
    - `_copyRectangularSelectionBackground`: Background thread worker
    - `_performRectangularCopy`: Shared copy implementation
  - Thread-aware UI messaging with wx.CallAfter for background operations

### Performance Impact
- **Cached Lookups**: Near-instant position retrieval (<1ms for cache hits)
- **Incremental Tracking**: 90%+ reduction in calculation time for local movements
- **Large Selections**: UI remains responsive during operations with 100+ rows
- **Overall**: Position operations at row 1000 reduced from ~500ms to <10ms (typical case)

### Technical Details
- Added `time` and `threading` imports for optimization infrastructure
- New `PositionCache` class with timestamp-based expiration
- `_calculatePosition` now uses three-tier strategy: cache → incremental → full calculation
- `_calculatePositionIncremental` handles bidirectional position calculation
- Thread safety ensured with threading.Lock for cache operations

## [1.0.14] - 2026-02-21

### Added - Feature Completion with API Research
- **Comprehensive API Research Documentation**
  - Created `API_RESEARCH_COORDINATE_TRACKING.md` (14,000+ words) with complete terminal API analysis
  - Created `SPEAKUP_SPECS_REQUIREMENTS.md` (9,000+ words) with consolidated feature specifications
  - Documented Windows Console API, NVDA TextInfo API, and UI Automation capabilities
  - Five implementation strategies analyzed with pros/cons for each approach
  - Complete code examples for all features ready for implementation

- **True Rectangular Selection with Column Tracking**
  - Implemented proper column-based rectangular selection (no longer simplified)
  - Calculates exact row/column coordinates for start and end marks
  - Extracts text from specific column ranges across multiple lines
  - Handles lines shorter than column range gracefully
  - Provides detailed feedback: "Rectangular selection copied: N rows, columns X to Y"
  - Uses new `_calculatePosition()` helper method for coordinate calculation

- **Coordinate-Based Window Tracking**
  - Window tracking now uses actual row/column coordinates (not bookmarks)
  - Checks if cursor position is within defined window boundaries
  - Silent when cursor moves outside window region
  - Announces normally when cursor moves within window boundaries
  - Falls back to standard tracking when window not properly defined

- **Window Content Reading**
  - Implemented true window content reading (no longer placeholder)
  - Reads text from specified row/column rectangular region
  - Extracts column ranges line by line from window boundaries
  - Speaks window content using speech.speakText()
  - Announces "Window is empty" when no content in region

- **Position Calculation Helper**
  - New `_calculatePosition(textInfo)` method returns (row, column) tuple
  - Counts from buffer start to determine line number (1-based)
  - Counts from line start to determine character position (1-based)
  - Used by position announcement, rectangular selection, and window tracking
  - Optimized `script_announcePosition` to use helper method (removed duplicate code)

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Coordinate Calculation Strategy**: Manual counting from buffer start using TextInfo.move()
  - O(n) complexity where n = row number (acceptable for typical terminal usage)
  - Position calculation via `compareEndPoints` and character/line unit moves
  - Returns (0, 0) on error for safe fallback behavior

- **Window Storage**: Changed from bookmarks to integer coordinates in config
  - `config.conf["TDSR"]["windowTop"]` - Top row boundary
  - `config.conf["TDSR"]["windowBottom"]` - Bottom row boundary
  - `config.conf["TDSR"]["windowLeft"]` - Left column boundary
  - `config.conf["TDSR"]["windowRight"]` - Right column boundary
  - Enables efficient boundary checking without TextInfo manipulation

- **Column Extraction**: Direct string slicing with proper index validation
  - Converts 1-based coordinates to 0-based indexing for Python strings
  - Handles short lines gracefully (empty string when line too short)
  - Strips line endings before column extraction
  - Joins lines with newlines for multi-line selections

### Research Findings
- **No Direct Coordinate Access**: NVDA TextInfo API does not provide row/column properties
- **Windows Console API Not Accessible**: Cannot access from NVDA add-ons due to process isolation
- **Manual Calculation Required**: Must count from buffer start for all coordinate operations
- **Performance Considerations**: Position calculation O(n) but acceptable for typical use
- **Future Optimization**: Position caching system documented for future enhancement

### Files Changed
- `addon/globalPlugins/tdsr.py`: +127 lines
  - Added `_calculatePosition()` helper method
  - Implemented true rectangular selection (replaced simplified version)
  - Implemented coordinate-based window tracking (replaced skeletal version)
  - Implemented window content reading (replaced placeholder)
  - Refactored `script_announcePosition` to use helper method

### Known Limitations (Addressed)
- ✅ **Rectangular Selection**: NOW FULLY IMPLEMENTED with column tracking
- ✅ **Window Tracking Mode**: NOW FULLY IMPLEMENTED with coordinate-based boundaries
- ⚠️ **Performance**: Position calculation O(n) - future caching system planned for optimization
- ⚠️ **Unicode Width**: Basic implementation - wcwidth library support for CJK characters planned

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing features unchanged
- Window configuration uses existing settings structure
- Graceful fallback to standard tracking on errors
- No breaking changes to user experience

## [1.0.13] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed - NVDA Compliance and Code Quality
- **Critical Gesture Conflicts Resolved**

  - Changed settings gesture from NVDA+Alt+C to NVDA+Alt+Shift+S
  - NVDA+Alt+C now exclusively handles copying linear selection
  - NVDA+Alt+R now exclusively handles toggling mark positions

- **NVDA Coding Standards Compliance**
  - Replaced all bare `except:` handlers with specific exception types
  - `except (ValueError, AttributeError)` for config/GUI operations
  - `except (KeyError, AttributeError)` for gesture binding cleanup
  - `except (RuntimeError, AttributeError)` for TextInfo operations
  - Improves error handling and debugging per PEP 8 standards

- **Punctuation Level System Applied Consistently**
  - Replaced all remaining `processSymbols` references with `_shouldProcessSymbol()` helper
  - Key echo now uses punctuation level system (was still using old boolean)
  - Cursor tracking now uses punctuation level system
  - Repeated symbol announcement now uses punctuation level system
  - Ensures consistent symbol verbosity across all features

- **Code Organization Improvements**
  - Moved `import re` to module-level imports (was inline in two methods)
  - Removed duplicate `script_readCurrentCharPhonetic` method
  - Multi-press detection in `script_readCurrentChar` already handles phonetic reading
  - Eliminates redundant code and improves maintainability

### Changed
- Settings gesture moved to NVDA+Alt+Shift+S (from NVDA+Alt+C)
- Copy linear selection gesture now exclusively uses NVDA+Alt+C
- All exception handlers now specify exact exception types for better error isolation

### Documentation
- Updated all docstrings to reference punctuation level system instead of processSymbols
- Code comments clarified for exception handling rationale

- Gesture binding cleanup improved with specific exception handling
- File now follows NVDA coding standards more closely
- Better separation of concerns between selection methods
- All Python syntax validated successfully
- Zero bare exception handlers remaining

### Known Limitations
- **Rectangular Selection**: Current implementation is simplified and copies full lines rather than exact column ranges. Full implementation would require terminal-specific coordinate tracking beyond NVDA's standard TextInfo API capabilities.
- **Window Tracking Mode**: Skeletal implementation present but falls back to standard cursor tracking. Full implementation would require precise row/column coordinate tracking that varies by terminal application.
- These features are marked for future enhancement when terminal-specific APIs become available.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-19 (#9, #10)

### Fixed
- Fixed spell current word command (NVDA+Alt+K twice) - now properly binds navigator to terminal before accessing review cursor
- Fixed phonetic character announcement (NVDA+Alt+Comma twice) - now properly binds navigator to terminal before accessing review cursor

### Technical
- Added api.setNavigatorObject(self._boundTerminal) call in script_spellCurrentWord before calling _getWordAtReview()
